= Utility-Host-Only Setup

Deploying Openshift in an automated way typically depends on traditional network services like dhcp-server, dns, http, etc...  One method to deploying OCP is to set up a utility server to run these services.  This simplfies configuration and control of the deployment.

Alhtough the utility host can be preloaded with RHEL 7 or 8, at this time the majoirty of the testing is done with RHEL 8.

=== Prequisits

  * RHEL 7.9 or 8.0+
  * installed packages: git, ansible 2.9
  * configured (accessible) repos for base, optional/appstream and ansible
  * log on to cloud.redhat.com and get your pull-secret.txt
  * internet access (either direct or via proxy)

=== RHEL 8 @Base Installation

Starting with a simple deployment of RHEL 8

  * Configure Repos (subscription-manager register)
  * Install ansible-2.9
  * Install git

----
yum install git ansible
----

=== Clone git Repo

As the user 'root', change to you home directory and clone the source.

----
cd ~

git clone http://github.com/xtophd/OCP4-Workshop
----

=== Review the Change History

In the git project directory you just cloned, run the following to view the development activity and changes you need to be aware of.

----
cd ~/OCP4-Workshop

git log --oneline --decorate
----

=== Create Config Files

You can use a sample-config to start this process.  Please note that in this example we are using a "utility-host-only" template.

----
cd ./OCP4-Workshop/config

cp ../sample-configs/utility-host-only/* .
----

=== Edit Config Files

WARNING:  You must edit the config files for your deployment.  There is no magic installation.

Just like the name implies 'master-config.yml' is the main configuration file.  Most parameters should be straight forward, but
in particular you need to:

  * fix hostnames, mac addresses & ip addresses
  * set or comment out h_rhcosDEV and r_rhcosNIC accordingly

Adjust the workshopuser_username and workshopuser_password in the credentials.yml file.

Now, encrypt the file for security

----
ansible-vault encrypt credentials.yml
----


=== Place the Pull Secret

WARNING: The file /root/OCP4-Workshop/config/pull-secret.txt must exist on the deployer host before you continue.

NOTE: Pull secret URL: https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/metal/user-provisioned

Using a browser, go to redhat.com and retrieve the pull-secret.  You can either:

    - download the pull-secret.txt and transfer it to the config directory, OR
    - copy the pull-secret.txt to the paste buffer and then edit pull-secret.txt and paste the contents    

=== Run the Playbooks

Now it's time to run the playbooks which configure and enable the services in preparation for the Openshift cluster deployment.

----
cd ./OCP4-Workshop/
bash ocp4-workshop.sh all
----

Once the playbooks have completed without error, you can run the playbooks again with a different flag ('usher') to help guide your manual deployment.

----
cd ./OCP4-Workshop/
bash prepare-ocp4-workshop.sh usher
----
