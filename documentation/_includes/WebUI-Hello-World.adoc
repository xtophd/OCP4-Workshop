= WebUI: Hello World

This unit will mimic (as closely as possible) the exerices done in the CLI version of Hello World.

The objective is to step through everything needed to bring a "Hello, World!" program online in our Openshift Container Platform. Again, we are going to do it several different ways to illustrate some best and worst practices of container usage.

There are 6 fundamental steps to deploying an application in the Openshift Container Platform via the WebUI:

  . *login* - sign-on with proper credentials
  . *Create a Project*
  . *Deploy an Image*
  . *Expose a Route*
  . *Modify the Project, Build or Deployment*
  . *Validation*

NOTE: Arguably, in a production environment step-5 (making modifications) would normally be done before step-4 (exposing a route).  However, the end result is the same and it helps the repeatable consistancy of these exercises to just do things in this order.

Let's get started.

== My First Application

=== Sign-on as admin

If you have not already done so, please proceed to login to the Openshift WebUI as user *admin*.  Instructions for doing so are outlined in the unit *WebUI: First Time Login*.

====
image::ocp-webui-login-04.png[Login]
====

=== Create a Project

You can always get to the *Openshift Landing* page by clicking on the "Openshift Container Platform" logo in the top left corner.  

____
select `Create Project` from *My Projects* on the *Openshift Landing* page

.Use following details for Create Project
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui
*Display Name*:: Hello WebUI
*Description*:: My First WebUI App

select `Create`
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-create.png[Create Project]
====


You should notice that your new project "Hello WebUI" has been added to the list on the right.

____
select project `Hello WebUI` from *My Projects* on the *Openshift Landing* page
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-select.png[Select Project]
====

=== Deploy an Image

After selecting a project, the WebUI changes it's layout to 3 main elements and their components:

  . *Banner*
  ** *Logo:* Openshift Container Platform
  ** *Help* pull down
  ** *Profile and Administrative* pull down
  . *Navigation Bar*
  ** *Navicon*
  ** *Projects* pull down
  ** *Search Catalog*
  ** *Add to Project* pull down
  . *Menu*
  ** *Overview*
  ** *Applications*
  ** *Builds*
  ** *Resources*
  ** *Storage*
  ** *Monitoring*
  ** *Catalog*
  
As noted, the current working project is indicated in the pull down on the *Navigation Bar*.  This is important to monitor to ensure your actions are being applied to the correct project.

For the purposes of these introductory exercises, we are focused on `Applications`, `Builds` and `Storage`.  Other attributes of a *Project* will be covered in later units.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-image-deploy.png[Image Deploy]
====

____
select `Deploy Image` from project *Overview* page

select `Image Name` radio button

.use following datails for Image Specification
[horizontal]
*Image Name*:: registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7

press `Return` after entering the image name
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-image-name.png[Image Name]
====

If the image name was entered correctly, when you press `Return` (or hit the `Search` icon) you will see a brief summary of the specified image and additional parameters will appear in order to complete this phase.  Scroll down a bit and change the resource *Name* as shown below.

____
_complete the data entry_

.use following details for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui

select `Deploy` 

select the `Continue to Project Overview` link
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-resource-name.png[Resource Name]
====

The *Project Overview* page provides a high-level view of the project you just created including quick links to the *Deployment Config*, *Services*, *Routes*, *Pods* and more.  Take a moment to look it over and familiarize yourself with it.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-overview.png[Project Overview]
====

You just completed configuring Openshift to create a new application called *webui-hello* based on a container image named *httpd-24-rhel7* being pulled from *registry.access.redhat.com*.  There is actually a lot more going on behind the scenes, but for now we'll be satisfied with fact you've initiated the build and deployment of a containerized application.

=== Expose a Route

Time to configure a *route* and expose our new application to the network.

____
select `Create Route` from *Project Overview*

.use the following details for Create Route
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui
*Hostname*:: hello-webui.cloud.example.com

select `Create`
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-route-details.png[Create Route]
====

You should be returned to the Routes Overview page as shown.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-overview2.png[Project Overview]
====

==== Interim Validation

Provided that you have not been too efficient and completed exposing the route before the build finished, you can now click on the URL provided along the top of *Project Overview* page.

____
select exposed route `http://hello-webui.cloud.example.com` from the Project Overview
____

You should see the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux Test Page.  If you get an error response, it is probably an indication that the build is still in progress.  Just wait a minute and try again.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-verification.png[Application Verification]
====

==== Explore the Container

____
select `Applications` -> `Pods` from *Menu*

select `hello-webui-?-????` from pods list
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-pod-overview.png[Pod Overview]
====

One of the options in the pods overview page (ie: Details, Environment, Logs, Terminal and Events) is to connect to the active pods terminal.  

____
select `Terminal` from *Pods Summary*
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-pod-terminal.png[Pod Overview]
====

Now that you have connected to a shell in the active container, have a look around.  These are identical exercises to those performed in the CLI version of hellow-world.  If you are familiar with the terminal activites you can skip to **Making an authentic "Hello, World!"**.

Here are a few commands to explore the container's namespace (ie: environment).

.sh-4.2$
----
id
----

.Your output should look like this
[source,indent=4]
----
uid=1000120000 gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1000120000
----

.sh-4.2$
----
ps -ef
----
    
.Your output should look like this
[source,indent=4]
----
UID         PID   PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD

default      31      1  0 14:26 ?        00:00:18 httpd -D FOREGROUND
default      35      1  0 14:26 ?        00:00:18 httpd -D FOREGROUND
default      37      1  0 14:26 ?        00:00:18 httpd -D FOREGROUND
default      74      0  0 17:50 ?        00:00:00 /bin/sh
default      84     74  0 17:50 ?        00:00:00 ps -ef
----

Normally files serverd by httpd go into /var/www/html, but the security-conscious random uid does not have permissions to write to this directory (or any other directory than the tmp dirs).

.sh-4.2$
----
cd /var/www
    
ls -la

echo "Can I create a file" > testfile
----

.Your output should look like this
[source,indent=4]
----
total 0
drwxr-xr-x.  4 default root  33 Jul 17 17:12 .
drwxr-xr-x. 19 root    root 249 Jul 17 17:13 ..
drwxr-xr-x.  2 default root   6 May  9 13:18 cgi-bin
drwxr-xr-x.  2 default root   6 May  9 13:18 html

sh: testfile: Permission denied
----

The primary thing we are trying to point out here is that the UID the process is running with (ie: **1000120000**) does not have permissions to write to any part of the container filesystem except traditionally open directories like **/tmp** or **/var/tmp**.  In effect, that makes this base container alone rather useless for running real world applications.

Next, you will do a series of steps to make adjustments to the project in order to deploy a more usable helloworld application.

=== Modify the Project, Build or Deployment

The Openshift WebUI does not provide a native dialog for modifying all project attributes.  So, for this first objective you are either left with steps outlined in the CLI Helloworld exercises (ie: *oc edit namespace webui-hello*) OR using the `Import YAML/JSON` functionality of the WebUI.  

==== Edit Project Attributes

For our first solution, we are going to adjust the current project's security attributes by importing a YAML config file.  

____
select `Import YAML/JSON` from `Add to Project` pull down in *Navigation Bar*

select `Browse`

.use following details for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Filename*:: /var/tmp/webui-hello-namespace.txt

select `Create`

_a confirmation dialog will appear_

select `Replace` from *Confirmation Dialog*

select `Close` 
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-add-to-project.png[Add To Project]
====

Before you selected `Create` you had an opportunity to inspect the file.  The only change to the project's security attributes is _openshift.io/sascc.uid-range:1001/10000_.  This is identical to the change made during the CLI Hello World exercises using the `oc edit project` command line.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-yaml-create.png[Import YAML Create]
====
    
You should be returned to the project overview page.

==== Redeploy the Application

Since our modification only affected "Project" attributes, nothing triggered an automatice redeployment of the application.  Thus, you will need to initiate a new deployment manually.  

____
select `Deploy` from *three vertical dots* (far right) on *Project Overview*
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-redeploy.png[Re-Deploy]
====

What you have done by modifying the project security attributes is configure the effective UID of the soon to be redeployed application to be 1001.  This modification now enables permission to write in /var/www/html.  It is not as insecure as simply enabling root priviledges for the process, but already far less secure than then the previous configuration.

Let us proceed with completing our first "helloworld" deployment.

==== Explore the Container

____

select `Applications` -> `Pods` from *Menu*

select `Terminal` from *Pod Summary*
____

Here you can access a shell, poke around again and most importantly install a helloworld *index.html*.  

.sh-4.2$
----
id

cd /var/www

ls -la

curl helloworld3.cloud.example.com > /var/www/html/index.html
----

If you didn't notice, the source for *index.html* came from an application that was deployed during the CLI exercises.  Final step is to verify the application is functioning as expected.

=== Validation

____
select exposed route `http://hello-webui.cloud.example.com` from the *Project Overview*
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-verification2.png[Verification]
====

IMPORTANT: The solution you just completed is NOT a recommended solution on how to deploy a container for production use.  This solution was provided to touch on a few concepts unique to the Openshift Container Platform.  Take some time to review: container design, project attributes, process uid/gid (ie: namespaces) in a containerized environment, filesystems, etc...


// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


== Hello-WebUI II : Use emptyDir

As noted in solution #1, there is a security issue with the default UID and the filesystem permissions in base container's directory /var/www/html.  Solution #1 attacked the problem by changing the UID of the running process.

In this solution, we are going to create a volume (ie: filesystem) which provides sufficient read/write permissions for the default (and more secure) UID.

We begin this solution by repeating the steps to deploy a httpd base image.

=== Create a Project

____
select `Create Project` from *My Projects* on the *Openshift Landing* page

.use following details for Create Project
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui2
*Display Name*:: Hello WebUI II
*Description*:: My Second WebUI App

select `Create`
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello1-project-create.png[Create Project]
====

You should notice that your new project "Hello WebUI II" has been added to the list on the right.  

____
select project `Hello WebUI II` from *My Projects* on the *Openshift Landing* page
____

=== Deploy an Image

____
select `Deploy Image` from project *Overview* page

select `Image Name` radio button

.use following datails Application Configuration

[horizontal]
*Image Name*:: registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7

press `Return` after entering the image name
____

If the image name was entered correctly, when you press `Return` (or hit the `Search` icon) you will see a brief summary of the specified image and additional parameters will appear in order to complete this phase.  Scroll down a bit and change the resource *Name* as shown below.

____
_complete the data entry_

.use following details for Application Configuration
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui2

select `Deploy` 

select the `Continue to Project Overview` link
____

====
image::ocp-webui-hello2-project-overview.png[Project Overview]

=== Expose a Route

____
select `Create Route` from *Project *Overview*

.use following details for Create Route
[horizontal]
*Name*:: hello-webui2
*Hostname*:: hello-webui2.cloud.example.com

select `Create`
____

You should be returned to the Routes Overview page as shown.

====
image::ocp-webui-hello2-routes-overview.png[Create Route]
====

=== Modify the Project, Build or Deployment

Now comes the step of configuring our new volume (ie: filesystem).  For this purpose we are utilizing a special type of volume called an "emptyDir".  This type of volume is created when a Pod is assigned to a Node, and exists as long as that Pod is running on that node.  What does that mean?  It means that the volume is *NOT* persistent and that data stored in the volume will be lost when the pod is stopped.  It also means that the volume will be *empty* when the pod starts (hence the name: emptyDir).

For real world use cases, emptyDir is often used as a local cache.  Since the backing store for emptyDir comes from the local host it is often more performant than network base storage.

Never the less, it suits our needs for this exercise so let's proceed to configure an emptyDir.  The WebUI does not provide a ellegant solution configuring an emptyDir, so we will resort to editing the deployment configuration YAML.

____
select `Applications` -> `Deployments` from *Menu*

Select `hello-webui2` deployment

select `Edit Yaml` from `Actions` pull-down
____

In the editing block (window), scroll down to line 44 or thereabouts and find *name: hello-webui2*.  On the next line, insert the following block:

.Edit YAML File
[source,yaml,indent=4]
----
volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /var/www/html
    name: hello-webui2-vol
----

====
image::ocp-webui-hello2-yaml-edit1.png[YAML Edit 1]
====

Now scroll down to line 60 or thereabouts and find **terminationGracePeriodSeconds**.  On the next line, insert the following block:

.Edit YAML File Continued
[source,yaml,indent=4]
----
volumes:
  - name: hello-webui2-vol
    emptyDir: {}
----

====
image::ocp-webui-hello2-yaml-edit2.png[YAML Edit 2]
====

____
select `Save`
____

Provided there are no errors, updating a deployment configuation in this manor will *automatically* trigger a new deployment of our application.

==== Explore the Container

____
select `Applications` -> `Pods` from *Menu*

select `hellow-webui2-????` pod

select `Terminal` from *Pod Summary*
____

From here you can access the shell, inspect the filesystem mounted on /var/www/html and install a helloworld *index.html* as shown below.

.sh-4.2$
----
id

cd /var/www/

ls -la

curl helloworld3.cloud.example.com > /var/www/html/index.html
----

==== Validation

IMPORTANT:  Again, it is critical to understand that this is also NOT a recommended solution to deploying an application into production on Openshift.  This solution utilizes an emptyDir storage volume which is non-persistent.  If the application is stopped and restarted, fails and restarts, is scaled up ... the changes you introduced to the single image by manually copying index.html to the image will not be replicated or restored.

Provided that you have not been too efficient and completed exposing the route before the build finished, you can now click on the URL for your expose route to verify your deployment.

____
select exposed route `http://hello-webui2.cloud.example.com` from the *Project Overview*

=== Modify the Project, Build or Deployment

Fundamentally, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used.  In soluttion #2, we use a volume type of "emptyDir".

In the language of Kubernettes, a PV is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator. It is a resource in the cluster.  A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user (deployment).

Lastly, Persistent Volumes (PV) are "cluster" objects and thus are not namespaced (ie: they don't belong to projects).  They belong to, and are available to,  the whole cluster.

If all of this is confusing, don't worry about it now.  What it boils down to is that storage configuration in Openshift behaves like 2 magenets.  You have to configure a PV (with certain attributes) and a PVC (with certain attributes).  Once configured, if the attributes of a PV and PVC match then like magnets they'll find each other and bind.  Once a PV and PVC are bound, the volume is ready for use.

==== Create Persistent Volume (PV)

The WebUI does not currently provide a convinient dialog for creating PVs, thus we will import a YAML configuration file similar to what was does in the CLI counterpart to this exercise.

A sample YAML file is provided on the workstation to make this process easy.  It should look similar to one outlined below.

.Sample YAML to Configure PV
----
[source,indent=4]
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: nfs-helloworld // <1>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi  // <2>
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany  // <3>
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain // <4>
  nfs:  // <5>
    path: /exports/helloworld // <6>
    server: workstation.example.com // <7>
    readOnly: false
----
<1> name of the PV
<2> amount of storage allocated to this volume
<3> accessModes (a key element/label to match a PV and a PVC)
<4> volume reclaim policy Retain (in this case volume is preserved after pods terminate)
<5> the volume type being used (in this case the NFS plug-in)
<6> the NFS mount path (NFS export)
<7> the NFS server (can also be specified by IP address)

=== Hello-WebUI V : Use Dockerfile

So this solution is a bit more complicated.  As shown during the CLI exercises, deploying an application
based on a Dockerfile is pretty trivial.  In fact, the `oc new-app` commandline was the shortest and had the least amount of typing of all the CLI helloworld examples.

Using the WebUI, there is currently no method to natively invoke a *Docker Build Strategy*.  Thus we are left with the option of importing a YAML configuration file.  Once again, this workshop has provided a sample file to make the exercise fairly simply to execute.  However, we are going to spend some time discussing it in detail.  This will hopefully shed some light on how Openshift (ie: Kubernettes) functions.

First let us begin with how this YAML file was built.  That's simple, we used the `oc new-app` CLI tool.

.[root@workstation ~]#
----
oc login master:8443 -u admin
     
oc new-app https://github.com/xtophd/OCP-Workshop --context-dir=/src/dockerfile --name=hello-webui5 --dry-run -o yaml
----

The output of the above command is listed below.  Step through it and notice the individual stanzas (denoted by the leading '-').  There are sections for: 

  * ImageStream (for the source base php image)
  * ImageStream (for the final deployable image (ie: output))
  * BuildConfig

The reasons for noting specific items in each stanza is simply to point out the relationships between them.
The only step (definition) missing to having a completely deployed application at the end of ingesting this YAML is the exposed *route* which connects the outside world to the pod's *service*.

Review the output below and discuss each section.  Then proceed to the steps towards deploying the application.
