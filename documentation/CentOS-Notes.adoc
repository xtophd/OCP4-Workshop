= Outline of steps for using CentOS 7 as the deployhost.

NOTE: Starting with CentOS 7 now, we'll look at using a CentOS 8 Stream another time.

Assumptions

  * Internet or other complete repos for CentOS 7 are configured and availablie
  * Openshift installation relies on internet accessibility, these playbooks do not address a disconnected installation


== Starting with minimal installation

Install additional packages

----
yum install git ansible
----

It should be the default but verify that ansible 2.9 was installed

----
rpm -qa | grep ansible
----
